# Bengaluru House Price Prediction Project

The construction of a real estate price prediction project is explained in detail in this series of data science projects. We will first create a model using the Bengaluru Home Prices dataset from kaggle.com and linear regression.

Nearly all data science principles, including data loading and cleaning, outlier identification and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, gridsearchcv for hyperparameter tuning, k fold cross validation, etc., were covered in the process of developing a model. 






## Technology Used

**1.** Python

**2.** Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning

**3.** Matplotlib for data visualization

**4.** Sklearn for model building

**5.** Jupyter notebook, visual studio code and pycharm as IDE
